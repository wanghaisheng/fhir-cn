<h2 id="2-9_Using_Resources_with_Services"><span class="sectioncount">2.9<a name="2.9"> </a></span> Using Resources with Services</h2><p>Though FHIR Resources are primarily designed with for the <a href="http.html">RESTful HTTP-based implementation</a>,<br>it is not necessary to use a RESTful interface when exchanging the resources; one way that they can be exchanged<br>is in the context of services. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architecture pattern using services to encapsulate and provide discreet pieces of application functionality to each other. Services communicate<br>by invoking public interfaces and exchanging information (as parameters and outputs) in accordance to a<br>well-defined service contract. </p>
<p>FHIR resources or <a href="extras.html#bundle">bundles</a> may be used as the parameters or outputs of service interfaces.</p>
<p>Generally, the definition of particular services is a domain or context specific task, and it is anticipated<br>that this would be done as separate specifications that make use of the underlying facilities defined<br>in this specification. Services defined like this are able to build on the common underlying platform<br>features defined in this specification such as REST or messaging, and add specific interactions where<br>appropriate. Alternatively, the service interfaces can build an entirely separate implementation.<br>At this time, FHIR does not define any specific service interfaces as part of the specification,<br>though alignment with service interface definitions provided by the<br><a href="http://hssp.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">HL7 SOA work group</a> will be considered if<br>there is sufficient interest in this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DSTU Notice</strong>: The RESTful interface is a profile on the existing <a href="http://hssp-rlus.wikispaces.com/RLUS_FAQ" target="_blank" rel="external">HL7/OMG HSSP<br>RLUS specification</a> (see <a href="http.html#hdata">comments on the RESTful specification</a>).<br>If there is interest, HL7 could define a SOAP equivalent to this. The main interest<br>in this would be to provide a common technical base for other SOAP based services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When implementing exchange of resources using a service-based approach, there are two<br>aspects to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical requirements when exchanging resources</li>
<li>FHIR architectural issues to consider when using services</li>
</ul>
<p>Both these impact on how services should manage exchanging resources in their design<br>and implementation.</p>
<p><a name="tech"> </a></p>
<h2 id="2-9_Technical_Requirements"><span class="sectioncount">2.9<a name="2.9"> </a></span> Technical Requirements</h2><p>Resources are designed so the package that is &quot;the resource&quot; consists of data (the content inside the resource,<br>and metadata - additional fields that are actually stored and exchanged outside the resource). In the<br>RESTful context, these fields are part of the HTTP header, and their functionality is integrated into<br>the HTTP exchange. When the resources are used with a service, this data must either be exchanged with<br>the resource, or the functionality they provide replaced in some way.</p>
<p>A key question in this regard is whether the resources that are exchanged across a service interface<br>need to also be handled in a RESTful context around the service. For example, a decision support<br>provider service might receive a collection of resources on which a decision is required, and<br>use an internal RESTful service to store and access them. In this case, it would need to take<br>the resources out of the service context, and use them in a RESTful context, and generally the<br>service would expect to see duplicate resources over time, where versions must be managed<br>correctly. If the resources to be exchanged over services are also to<br>be exchanged with REST, the metadata will be required.</p>
<p><strong>Resource Identity</strong></p>
<p>All resources have a single identity (the full URL), and a logical id which may be maintained<br>as the resource moves from server to server (see <a href="managing.html">&quot;Managing Resource Identity&quot;</a> for further<br>discussion). Since this identity is used by any reference to the resource, it must be exchanged<br>with the resource so that references from other resources to the one being exchanged can<br>still be resolved.</p>
<p>Related to this, resources are modular units that refer to each other. Although<br>resources stand-alone and are each processed independently, it’s rarely possible<br>to use a resource to achieve some clinical or business goal without retrieving the<br>other referenced resources. Any use of resources in a service environment needs to<br>address how these references can be resolved. This can be achieved by delegating<br>the reference resolution to a RESTful framework, by ensuring that all the relevant<br>resources are contained in the service call, or by making some service based arrangement<br>by which additional resources can be retrieved.</p>
<p>Services that exchange resources SHALL maintain resource identity.</p>
<p><strong>Resource Version</strong></p>
<p>Resources have two metadata elements relating to versioning: &quot;Version Id&quot; and &quot;Last Modified Date&quot;.<br>Because of data/time resolution issues, systems implementing concurrency solutions are<br>strongly recommended to depend on the version id; the Last Modified Date is provided to<br>inform human users about information currency. </p>
<p>Services typically assume that the information in the service calls is the latest<br>information. As a consequence, explicit version tracking is often not part of a<br>service call. However if the resources in the service call then need to be used<br>in a RESTful fashion, explicitly tracking the version and last modified date<br>will make this subsequent usage much more efficient.</p>
<p>Services that exchange resources SHOULD include version information when the resources are exchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement</strong></p>
<p>When using <a href="http.html">RESTful exchange</a>, <a href="messaging.html">messaging</a>, and <a href="documents.html">document based</a><br>exchange, the <a href="conformance.html">conformance statement</a> allows authoring and reading<br>applications to describe how they use a resource. The conformance statement supports trading partner<br>negotiation from specification time through to run-time discovery. The conformance statement doesn’t<br>provide any equivalent way to make declarations about services, though this might be added in<br>the future if common requirements emerge. Services are expected to make appropriate arrangements<br>around discovery and compatibility, though it is expected that these will vary considerably. </p>
<p>Services that exchange resources MAY choose to provide support for describing and<br>changing descriptions of service implementations.</p>
<p><a name="architecture"> </a></p>
<h2 id="2-9_Architectural_Considerations"><span class="sectioncount">2.9<a name="2.9"> </a></span> Architectural Considerations</h2><p>FHIR Resources are designed to make use in a wide variety of contexts. In particular,<br>FHIR resources are required to be suitable for use in a REST environment. This means<br>that there are number of design requirements and choices that impact on how suitable<br>resources are for use with services. </p>
<p>If service use was the only consideration, different decisions would be made, and<br>resources would be more suitable for use with services. However this would curtail<br>their usefulness and reusability in other contexts. </p>
<p><strong>Resource References</strong></p>
<p>The most obvious impact is that resources <a href="references.html">refer to each other using full URL<br>based references</a>, and there are a number of rules around how these references are<br>resolved. In the context of a service, this means that the references between modules<br>carry this extra weight of choice and obligation, even when it might not be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Explicit State</strong></p>
<p>All resources represent the various states of the record and real world entities involved<br>in a transaction explicitly. This is necessary for use in RESTful and document contexts,<br>where there is no explicit transaction. Service interactions are typically associated with<br>implicit semantics - a request to change the status of a particular resource to something<br>else, for example. The fact that resources carry this state explicitly as well as the<br>transaction fixing state implicitly creates duplication between the two, and this will<br>need to be managed.</p>
<p><strong>Modularity</strong></p>
<p>The modularity of resources - which resources are defined, and why - is driven by<br>a wide set of considerations around how they are used. Resources are a platform on<br>which a set of business/clinical services of various kinds are provided. Accordingly, the resources<br>are defined for general use, and they can be expected to be less suitable for a<br>particular service than custom defined structures. The pay back is wider re-use<br>of the information that the service deals with.</p>
