<h2><span class="sectioncount">1.9.3<a name="1.9.3"> </a></span> Clinical Document Architecture (CDA)</h2>
<a name="cda"> </a>
<p>
CDA is HL7's most widely adopted V3 standard.  It provides both a standardized 
header containing metadata about the document as well as the ability to convey 
a wide variety of clinical content organized into various sections.  The document 
content can be un-encoded, such as a PDF through to a fully encoded V3 instance.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: While FHIR can be used to create <a href="documents.html">documents</a> using 
the <a href="composition.html">Composition Resource</a>, FHIR can also be used to 
exchange traditional CDA R2 documents making use of the <a href="documentreference.html">DocumentReference</a> 
resource, and handling the CDA document itself as a binary attachment (as XDS does).
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.9.3.1<a name="1.9.3.1"> </a></span> CDA Similarities and Differences</h3>
<p>
<b>Clinical document focus:</b> As its name implies, Clinical Document Architecture 
is limited &quot;clinical&quot; use cases.  The CDA model does not support exchange of content 
not deemed to have clinical relevance, such as financial information and is limited to 
documents that deal with patients.  (In some cases, such as the HL7 Structured Product 
Labeling standard, non-patient-specific CDA-like specifications are created to get 
around this limitation.)  FHIR documents have no limitation on their content and can 
have subjects other than patients.
</p>
<p>
<b>Human readability approach:</b> CDA and FHIR both require that content be 
human-readable and define specific rules for how the human readable text is presented.  
One small difference is that in CDA, the human readable portion is defined for the 
section, while for FHIR the text is on the resource the section points to.  However, 
this produces no real difference in effect.  The other difference is that, for FHIR, 
the human-readable aspect is not limited to the document - it's driven by the resource 
itself.  This may result in slightly less flexibility in rendering approach if a document 
is compiling existing resources.
</p>
<p>
<b>Clinical Statement vs. resources:</b> In CDA, the &quot;content&quot; of the document is expressed 
using a complex and extremely abstract model based on HL7's &quot;Clinical Statement&quot; project.  
Its purpose is to allow implementers to express pretty much any clinical concept in any degree 
of rigor and granularity.  (In practice, there are limitations built into the CDA model that 
make the expression of certain clinical concepts challenging).  This model provides significant 
power, but also presents challenges.  The first is that RIM modeling expertise is required in 
order to express any particular piece of clinical information.  It isn't obvious how to 
represent things like allergies or surgery or blood pressure &quot;out of the box&quot;.  Templates are 
required to support interoperability.  The second is that common clinical concepts can be (and 
frequently are) modeled differently in different circumstances.  With FHIR, all clinical (and 
non-clinical) content in a message is handled by referencing existing resource definitions.  
These resources make it clear how to represent common structures like allergies and blood 
pressure &quot;out of the box&quot; and ensure that there's only one way for core content to be 
represented.  It does however create the limitation that an appropriate resource must have 
been defined in order to share content.  In the early stages of FHIR development, it may be 
necessary to make use of the <a href="other.html">Other</a> resource if an appropriate standard 
resource has not yet been defined.
</p>
<p>
<b>Templates and Profiles:</b> As discussed above, CDA relies on the presence of templates in 
order to understand the meaning of instances.  (While the meaning can theoretically be determined 
by looking at RIM attributes and codes, the reality is that this is often not safe or sufficient.  
As such, pretty much every CDA instance includes <i>templateId</i> attribute values scattered 
throughout the instance to define meaning.  With FHIR, meaning is defined by the resource.  
<a href="profile.html">Profiles</a> can be used to define extensions, but they never refine the 
meaning of core elements.  While the profiles used in constructing a particular instance can be 
declared within the instance via <a href="extras.html#tag">tags</a>.  However, such declaration 
is not required.
</p>
<p>
<b>Mark-up language:</b> CDA defines its own XML syntax for narrative content, loosely based on 
HTML.  FHIR makes use of a constrained set of XHTML which is somewhat more expressive than the CDA 
markup.  Conversions from FHIR to CDA will need to take these constraints into account (or 
alternatively provide a fully rendered version of the document).
</p>

<h3><span class="sectioncount">1.9.3.2<a name="1.9.3.2"> </a></span> CDA Interoperability Considerations</h3>
<p>CDA is a type of V3 specification.  Therefore, all <a href="comparison-v3.html#V3-interoperability">considerations</a> 
that apply to V3 messaging also apply to CDA.  In addition, the following topics are specific to CDA 
implementations.</p>
<p>
<b>What to map:</b> The right-hand side (clinical content) portion of the CDA model qualifies as an 
abstract model <a href="comparison-v3.html#V3-abstractModels">as discussed above</a>.  While the CDA header can reasonably 
be mapped to the HL7 <a href="composition.html">Composition</a> resource and related resources, mappings 
between FHIR and CDA should be done at the template level rather than the CDA specification itself.
</p>
<p>
<b>Human readable granularity:</b> With FHIR, narrative only exists for the resources at the root of 
each section.  With CDA, narrative exists for each section.  Usually this means the narrative in CDA 
and FHIR will correspond.  However, in some cases, a section will contain other sub-sections.  In CDA, 
these &quot;container&quot; sections can have narrative.  In FHIR, they cannot.  Applications will need to have some 
way of managing this if converting.
</p>
<p>
<b>Discrete to human-readable linkages:</b> To ensure semantic traceability, both FHIR and CDA allow 
establishing linkages between text in the narrative and specific discrete elements in the encoded part 
of a document.  If converting between FHIR and CDA, these linkages need to be converted as well.  However, 
this is complicated by the fact that the granularity at which linkages can occur is different between the 
two specifications.  In CDA, linkages can only occur at the level of a section or one of a couple of the 
entry types.  With FHIR, linkages can occur at any level at all, including individual data type components 
or even portions of extensions.  Converting from CDA to FHIR will be straight-forward, however there will 
be information loss when converting the other way.
